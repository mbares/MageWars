If you are updating from version 1.0 to 2.0 (and getting some compiler errors):

1. Delete the script GestureRecognizer/Example/DragDetector
2. Select the GestureAssets you created, click on the "Convert..." button that appears at Inspector.
3. If something goes wrong, delete old GestureRecognition files and reimport the asset form Asset Store. But take care of files you created inside the folder.
